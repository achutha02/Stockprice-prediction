# Stockprice-prediction
This project presents a real-time stock price prediction system that helps users make informed decisions on buying or selling stocks. The system collects live market data and uses machine learning and deep learning algorithms to predict the opening and closing prices of various stocks. Users can search for stocks, view ongoing price trends, check past predictions, and track their own prediction history. The system also allows users to create a personalized watchlist to follow selected stocks. It offers a simple and user-friendly interface to support both new and experienced traders. The project also provides an admin panel accessible by super-users to perform CRUD operations, manage stock listings, user data, and monitor system activities. The aim of this project is to offer an intelligent, accessible, and efficient platform for stock market analysis and trading decision support.
